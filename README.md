# RUHacks

How we built it:

We have a MERN stack which covers our backend and frontend. The project is node based, we use MongoDb to store our billing information in JSON form. The API endpoints are set up in Express.js and the frontend utilizes React's component based structure. We built several endpoints which provide us essential functionality such as retreiving a list of bills, calling the Google Vision OCR Engine, and adding bills to an associated user. One of the primary challenges we solved was gaining the ability to make requests from a different port on the localhost from React. The user interface was initially crafted in HTML using basic CSS styling, and was later converted into JSX code in the components.
